# Settin' Up the Pi

## OS

### Choice of Raspbian

I used [Hypriot](https://hypriot.com "Hypriot") at first, but once [Docker](https://www.docker.com "Docker") arrived in-model for [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org "Raspbian") it made more sense for me to to use Raspbian as the base OS because I have many years of experience administering [Debian](https://www.debian.org/ "Debian") systems.

Some very useful resources have been:
* <https://blog.hypriot.com/getting-started-with-docker-and-linux-on-the-raspberry-pi/> for installing an Raspbian (or any OS) on an RPi.
* <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/> for the Raspberry Pi Foundation's Raspbian image
  * specifically, <https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest> 

### Installation

#### offboard bootstrap 
bootstrap hosted here: https://github.com/michaeldallen/raspbian_bootstrap

* get [Hypriot's flash tool](https://github.com/hypriot/flash)

working on this:
* docker container containing tools for imaging
* run container as privileged pushd to dockerhub/whatever
* store metadata for re-image on SD card /boot partition
  * means manual first-time config
  * should sync metadata config to github/whatever
* use SD card metadata for re-imaging

* setting hostname with hyperiot flash does not affect image
  * whatever the hook is must be part of the hyperiot special sauce, not part of the raspbian special sauce
  * move this functionality into onboard bootstrap

#### onboard bootstrap

do it like this:
* 00 raspi-config
* 20 apt/raspbian/OS
* 40 chef/config

going long with chef
* apt-get --assume-yes install chef (TODO: need to defeat server popup)

nascent https://github.com/michaeldallen/raspbian_bootstrap/tree/master/v2 looks pretty good - enough for now
