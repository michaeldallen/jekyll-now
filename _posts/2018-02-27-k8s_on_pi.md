## Settin' Up the Pi

### OS

### Choice of Raspbian

I used [Hypriot](https://hypriot.com "Hypriot") at first, but once [Docker](https://www.docker.com "Docker") arrived in-model for [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org "Raspbian") it made more sense for me to to use Raspbian as the base OS because I have many years of experience administering [Debian](https://www.debian.org/ "Debian") systems.

Some very useful resources have been:
* <https://blog.hypriot.com/getting-started-with-docker-and-linux-on-the-raspberry-pi/> for installing an Raspbian (or any OS) on an RPi.
* <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/> for the Raspberry Pi Foundation's Raspbian image
  * specifically, <https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest> 

### Installation

* get [Hypriot's flash tool](https://github.com/hypriot/flash)
