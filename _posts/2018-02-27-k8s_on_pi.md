# Raspberry Pi

## OS

### Choice of Raspbian

I used <https://hypriot.com> at first, but once <https://www.docker.com> arrived in-model for <https://www.raspbian.org> it makes more sense for me to to use Raspbian as the base OS because I have many years of experience administering <https://www.debian.org/> systems.

Some very useful resources have been:
* <https://blog.hypriot.com/getting-started-with-docker-and-linux-on-the-raspberry-pi/> for installing an Raspbian (or any OS) on an RPi.
* <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/> for the Raspberry Pi Foundation's Raspbian image
** specifically, <https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest>
