Today Jana and I fiddled around with the menus by adding menu items
and highlighting the active page in the nav bar.  Works well with the
_airspace_ theme used in the tutorial.  The `class="active"` style
doesn't seem to do much in _jekyll-now_ (which I'm using for this
site).

I'm building two sites as I listen to the course: one using
_airscape_, and this one using _jekyll-now_.  In this site I plan to
pen some thoughts about moving from working as a sysadmin to working
in devops.  I'm hoping to learn something as I go, organize my
thoughts by going through the process of writing them down, and take
my fist forray into a public internet presence.
